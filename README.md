PROG POE PART 2




Welcome to the Poe_part1 program This simple but engaging chatbot application does a few cool things. First, it greets you with a voice message, then it displays a logo as ASCII art, and finally, it interacts with you to answer questions about cybersecurity. Think of it as a fun little AI assistant that can help you learn more about topics like password security, phishing, and safe browsing.
The program is divided into three main part

1.	Voice Greeting: Plays a sound to welcome you.
2.	Logo Display: Turns an image into ASCII art and shows it in the console.
3.	Chatbot Interaction: The AI chatbot responds to your cybersecurity-related questions.
And, if you ever want to leave, just type "exit," and the program will say goodbye and close. 

How It Works
. Voice Greeting
When you run the program, the first thing that happens is the AI greets you with a voice. It plays a .wav audio file, Recording 1.wav, which is located in the root directory of the project. This gives the program a bit of personality right from the start

. Logo as ASCII Art
After the greeting, the program moves on to the fun part: the logo. It takes an image (logo.jpeg), resizes it, and turns it into ASCII art. The image is displayed in the console as a collection of characters. 

. Chatbot Interaction
The heart of the program is the chatbot itself, which asks for your name and then starts chatting with you about cybersecurity. You can ask questions like:
•	How are you?
•	What’s your purpose?
•	What can I ask you about?
•	Tell me about passwords.
•	What is phishing?
•	How can I browse safely?
If the chatbot recognizes what you’re asking, it will give you a helpful response. If it’s not sure, it will politely ask you to rephrase your question. If at any point you get tired and want to exit, just type exit and the chatbot will wish you goodbye.
Personalized Interaction: The chatbot greets users by name and remembers details from previous interactions, creating a more engaging experience.

Sentiment-Aware Responses: By analyzing user input for emotional cues (e.g., "worried", "happy"), the chatbot tailors its responses to address the user's state of mind, enhancing empathy and relevance.

Dynamic Knowledge Base: The chatbot provides information on various cybersecurity topics such as passwords, phishing, and malware, adapting its responses based on user interests and previous conversations.

Interactive Learning: Users can ask questions like "Tell me about phishing", and the chatbot offers informative responses, promoting cybersecurity awareness.

Exit Protocol: Typing "exit" gracefully ends the conversation, ensuring a polite and user-friendly experience.


. Running the Program
Once everything is set up, go ahead and run the program. Here’s what will happen:
•	You’ll hear the greeting sound.
•	You’ll see the logo, but in ASCII art form.
•	The chatbot will ask for your name and then start chatting with you about cybersecurity. You can ask it any of the predefined questions, and it will answer them. It’s like having a little cybersecurity assistant at your fingertips.

. Exiting the Program
When you're done, just type exit, and the chatbot will say goodbye and close the program.
